Hands-on-II
House Prices Classification and Regression Models
Project Overview
In this project, I have built both classification and regression models using the House Prices dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to explore and predict House Prices using different machine learning techniques.

Models Developed
Classification Models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Regression Models:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Ridge and Lasso Regression
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Ridge, Lasso Regression and Elasti Regressions

Each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared for regression.
